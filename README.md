# Movie Search

I was bored so I decided to learn React and make this movie search app. It's nothing fancy, just some queries to the [moviedb](https://themoviedb.org) API.

## Development

Clone this repo, cd into it (`cd movie-search`) then run `npm install`. `npm run dev` spins up a local development server.

Don't forget to add environment variables for the API key, API endpoint, and the endpoint for the movie poster image in a `.env` file.
